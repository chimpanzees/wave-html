A simple preprocessor for ***Hyper Text Markup Language***.

This project is still in development! Please view ***Important notice*** for more information.

## Introduction

***Wave .html*** *is a project that adds some extra functionality to* ***Hyper Text Markup Language*** *pages. An example input and output file are added in the examples folder in the original repo on Github.*

### Variables

*The compiler makes it possible to add variables to basic* ***Hyper Text Markup Language*** *pages. You should start by declaring a new variable using the code below. The* ***~*** *means a new variable will be declared. Using the variable in the page is as simple as calling it with a* ***'.'*** *in front of it. By calling a variable, the complete tag will be replaced by the value of the named variable. Make sure you declare variables before calling them! Otherwise they will be replaces by 'undefined'.*

***Declaring a variable:***

`<!-- ~title Hello World! -->`

***Calling a variable:***

`<title><!-- .title --></title>`

***Results in:***

`<title>Hello World!</title>`

### Includes

***Wave-html*** *also makes it possible to include different html files. Simply write the following code, and the compiler will replace the tag with the content of the destination file.*

***Including a file:***

`<!-- .include footer.html -->`

## Important notice

*I wrote this in less than two hours, so the current version is not stable. This will change in the near future, I just need this for another project I am working on.*

## Installation

*Call the compiler from the command line by using the `wave` command. The output argument is optional. If this argument is not given, the output destination will automatically set to output.html.*

`$ sudo npm install -g wave-html`

`$ wave input.html output.html`
